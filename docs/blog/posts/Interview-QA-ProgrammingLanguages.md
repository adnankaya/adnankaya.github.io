???+ question "1. What is a variable?"
    Answer: A variable is a storage location in memory with a name and a value that can change during the execution of a program.
    Variables allow you to store data that can be referenced and manipulated later. For example, `int age = 25;` stores the number 25 in a variable called `age`.

??? question "2. What are data types?"
    Answer: Data types specify the kind of data that can be stored in a variable, such as integers, floats, strings, or booleans.
    They help the compiler or interpreter understand how the programmer intends to use the data. For example, `int`, `float`, `char`, and `boolean` are common data types.

??? question "3. What is an array?"
    Answer: An array is a collection of elements, all of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations.
    Arrays allow you to store multiple values in a single variable, like a list of numbers or strings. For example, `int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};` creates an array of integers.

??? question "4. What is a loop?"
    Answer: A loop is a programming construct that repeats a block of code as long as a condition is true.
    Common types include `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops. Loops are used to perform repetitive tasks efficiently, like iterating over elements in an array.

??? question "5. What is an `if` statement?"
    Answer: An `if` statement is a conditional statement that executes a block of code only if a specified condition evaluates to true.
    For example, `if (age > 18)` checks if the variable `age` is greater than 18 and executes the corresponding code if true.

??? question "6. What is a function?"
    Answer: A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task and can be called with arguments to return a value.
    Functions help in breaking down a program into smaller, manageable parts. For example, `int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }` defines a function to add two numbers.

??? question "7. What is recursion?"
    Answer: Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem.
    Recursion is useful for tasks like traversing trees or solving factorial problems. However, it requires a base case to prevent infinite loops.

??? question "8. What is a class?"
    Answer: A class is a blueprint for creating objects in object-oriented programming, containing attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods).
    Classes encapsulate data and functions to represent real-world entities. For example, a `Car` class might have attributes like `color` and methods like `drive()`.

??? question "9. What is an object?"
    Answer: An object is an instance of a class that contains data and methods as defined by the class blueprint.
    In object-oriented programming, objects represent real-world entities. For example, `Car myCar = new Car();` creates an object `myCar` of the class `Car`.

??? question "10. What is inheritance?"
    Answer: Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming where one class (child class) inherits attributes and methods from another class (parent class).
    Inheritance promotes code reuse. For example, a `Dog` class can inherit from an `Animal` class and gain access to common methods like `eat()`.

??? question "11. What is polymorphism?"
    Answer: Polymorphism is the ability in object-oriented programming to present the same interface for different underlying data types.
    It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. For example, a `Dog` and `Cat` class might both implement a `speak()` method differently.

??? question "12. What is encapsulation?"
    Answer: Encapsulation is the practice of hiding the internal details of an object and only exposing a controlled interface.
    It helps protect an object’s state by restricting direct access to its fields and methods. For example, using private fields and providing getter/setter methods.

??? question "13. What is abstraction?"
    Answer: Abstraction is the concept of hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary features of an object.
    In programming, abstraction allows us to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it. For example, you can drive a car without knowing its engine workings.

??? question "14. What is a constructor?"
    Answer: A constructor is a special method in a class that is called when an object is instantiated, typically used to initialize the object’s state.
    Constructors help set up initial values for object properties. For example, `public Car(String color)` initializes a `Car` object with a specific color.

??? question "15. What is a destructor?"
    Answer: A destructor is a special method in object-oriented programming that is called when an object is destroyed, typically used to release resources.
    In languages like C++, destructors help in memory management, cleaning up resources like file handles or memory allocations when an object is no longer needed.

??? question "16. What is method overloading?"
    Answer: Method overloading is a feature in object-oriented programming where multiple methods can have the same name but differ in parameters (number, type, or order).
    It allows functions with similar logic to be grouped, improving readability. For example, you might have `add(int a, int b)` and `add(double a, double b)`.

??? question "17. What is method overriding?"
    Answer: Method overriding is a feature where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.
    It allows a subclass to change the behavior of a method inherited from a parent class. For example, a `Dog` class might override the `speak()` method from the `Animal` class.

??? question "18. What is the difference between `==` and `equals()` in object comparison?"
    Answer: `==` checks if two object references point to the same memory location, while `equals()` checks if the values of the objects are the same.
    In most languages, `==` compares references, whereas `equals()` compares the actual data. For example, two different `String` objects with the same text would be `equal` but not `==`.

??? question "19. What is a static method?"
    Answer: A static method belongs to the class rather than an instance of the class and can be called without creating an object.
    Static methods are useful for utility functions like `Math.sqrt()` that don’t require any data from an instance of the class.

??? question "20. What is the difference between `break` and `continue` statements?"
    Answer: The `break` statement terminates the loop entirely, while the `continue` statement skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.
    `break` is used to exit loops when a certain condition is met, and `continue` is used when you want to skip an iteration based on a condition.

??? question "21. What is a lambda function?"
    Answer: A lambda function is an anonymous function that can be defined in a single line and passed as a value in languages that support functional programming.
    Lambda functions are useful for short, throwaway functions like sorting or filtering lists. For example, in Python: `lambda x: x * 2` defines a function to double a number.

??? question "22. What is functional programming?"
    Answer: Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state or mutable data.
    Functions in functional programming are first-class citizens and can be passed as arguments or returned from other functions. It emphasizes immutability and declarative code.

??? question "23. What is a higher-order function?"
    Answer: A higher-order function is a function that can take other functions as arguments and/or return a function as its result.
    Common examples include `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` in functional programming languages. These functions operate on collections and apply functions to each element.

??? question "24. What is an interface?"
    Answer: An interface is a contract in programming that specifies a set of methods that a class must implement, without dictating how they should be implemented.
    Interfaces enable loose coupling and provide a way to achieve abstraction. For example, a `Vehicle` interface might require an `accelerate()` method that is implemented differently in `Car` and `Bike` classes.

??? question "25. What is multiple inheritance?"
    Answer: Multiple inheritance is a feature where a class can inherit from more than one parent class, gaining the properties and methods of all parent classes.
    Not all languages support multiple inheritance due to potential conflicts, such as the "diamond problem" where the same method exists in multiple parent classes.

??? question "26. What is a module?"
    Answer: A module is a self-contained unit of code that encapsulates related functions, classes, and variables, often used to organize code in larger applications.
    Modules help promote reusability and separation of concerns. For example, in Python, you might create a `math` module to handle mathematical functions.

??? question "27. What is an API?"
    Answer: An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.
    APIs define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information, such as a weather API providing current weather data.

??? question "28. What is a string?"
    Answer: A string is a data type used to represent a sequence of characters, typically enclosed in quotation marks.
    Strings can store text data, such as names or messages, and offer various methods for manipulation, like concatenation or searching. For example, `String name = "John";` stores the name in a string variable.

??? question "29. What are control structures?"
    Answer: Control structures are programming constructs that dictate the order in which statements are executed in a program, such as loops and conditional statements.
    They allow programmers to control the flow of execution based on specific conditions, enabling decision-making within the code. Examples include `if`, `else`, `for`, and `while` statements.

??? question "30. What is exception handling?"
    Answer: Exception handling is a programming construct that manages errors or exceptional conditions that occur during program execution.
    It allows developers to define how a program should respond to errors, enhancing robustness. For example, using `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks to handle exceptions in Java.

??? question "31. What is a list?"
    Answer: A list is a data structure that stores an ordered collection of items, allowing duplicates and dynamic resizing.
    Lists are useful for storing sequences of elements and can be manipulated with methods like adding, removing, or sorting items. For example, a list of names can be defined as `names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]`.

??? question "32. What is a dictionary?"
    Answer: A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs where each key is unique and is used to access its corresponding value.
    Dictionaries are useful for storing related data and enabling quick lookups. For example, `person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}` allows you to access `person["name"]` to retrieve "Alice".

??? question "33. What is the difference between `float` and `double`?"
    Answer: `Float` and `double` are both data types used to represent decimal numbers, but they differ in precision and memory usage.
    A `float` typically uses 32 bits, while a `double` uses 64 bits, allowing `double` to represent numbers with greater precision. For example, `float pi = 3.14f;` vs. `double pi = 3.141592653589793;`.

??? question "34. What is a pointer?"
    Answer: A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable, allowing direct memory manipulation and dynamic memory allocation.
    Pointers are powerful but can lead to complex bugs if not managed properly. For example, `int* ptr = &var;` stores the address of `var` in the pointer `ptr`.

??? question "35. What is garbage collection?"
    Answer: Garbage collection is an automatic memory management process that frees up memory by reclaiming objects that are no longer in use by a program.
    It helps prevent memory leaks and optimizes resource utilization. Languages like Java and Python use garbage collection to manage memory automatically.

??? question "36. What is a regular expression?"
    Answer: A regular expression is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern, typically used for string matching and manipulation.
    Regular expressions are useful for validating formats, like email addresses, or extracting information from text. For example, `^[\w-]+@([\w-]+\.)+[\w-]{2,4}$` is a regex for validating email addresses.

??? question "37. What is a namespace?"
    Answer: A namespace is a container that holds a set of identifiers (names) and allows the organization of code to avoid naming conflicts.
    Namespaces enable the grouping of related functions, classes, and variables. For example, in Python, `import math` creates a namespace for the `math` module.

??? question "38. What is type casting?"
    Answer: Type casting is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another, allowing for different data representations in programming.
    It is essential when performing operations involving different data types. For example, converting a string to an integer using `int("123")`.

??? question "39. What is an event?"
    Answer: An event is an action or occurrence recognized by a program that can trigger a response, such as user interactions (clicks, keystrokes).
    Events are central to event-driven programming, allowing applications to respond dynamically to user inputs or other stimuli. For example, a button click triggering a function to submit a form.

??? question "40. What is a framework?"
    Answer: A framework is a collection of pre-written code, libraries, and tools that provides a foundation for building applications.
    Frameworks streamline development by providing reusable components and standard practices. For example, Django is a framework for building web applications in Python.

??? question "41. What is an algorithm?"
    Answer: An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem or performing a task, often expressed in a programming language.
    Algorithms are essential for efficient problem-solving and can be represented in various forms, such as pseudocode or flowcharts. For example, a sorting algorithm defines how to arrange elements in order.

??? question "42. What is a stack overflow?"
    Answer: A stack overflow occurs when there is too much memory used on the call stack, typically due to deep or infinite recursion.
    It results in a program crash and indicates that the stack limit has been exceeded. For example, a function calling itself without a base case can lead to a stack overflow.

??? question "43. What is debugging?"
    Answer: Debugging is the process of identifying, isolating, and fixing problems or bugs in a program to ensure it functions correctly.
    It often involves using debugging tools to step through code and analyze variable states. For example, using breakpoints to halt execution and examine the current state of variables.

??? question "44. What is code refactoring?"
    Answer: Code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior to improve readability, maintainability, and performance.
    Refactoring helps in simplifying complex code and removing redundancies. For example, breaking a large function into smaller, reusable functions.

??? question "45. What is a user-defined data type?"
    Answer: A user-defined data type is a data type created by the programmer to group related data and methods into a single unit, enhancing code organization.
    Examples include classes, structures, and enumerations. For instance, a `Point` class might represent coordinates in a two-dimensional space.

??? question "46. What is the purpose of a `return` statement?"
    Answer: A `return` statement is used to exit a function and optionally send a value back to the calling code.
    It defines the output of a function and allows values to be reused in other parts of the program. For example, `return x + y;` returns the sum of `x` and `y`.

??? question "47. What is a global variable?"
    Answer: A global variable is a variable declared outside any function and is accessible from any part of the program.
    Global variables are useful for sharing data between functions, but excessive use can lead to code that is hard to understand and maintain.

??? question "48. What is a local variable?"
    Answer: A local variable is a variable declared within a function and is only accessible within that function’s scope.
    Local variables help encapsulate data, reducing the risk of unintended interference from other parts of the program.

??? question "49. What is the significance of the main function?"
    Answer: The main function serves as the entry point for program execution in many programming languages.
    It defines where the program starts and may return a value indicating the program's execution status. For example, `int main() { return 0; }` signifies successful execution in C/C++.

??? question "50. What is a syntax error?"
    Answer: A syntax error is a mistake in the code that violates the rules of the programming language, preventing the program from compiling or running.
    Syntax errors can include misspellings, incorrect punctuation, or improper use of language constructs. For example, forgetting a semicolon at the end of a statement in languages like C or Java.

??? question "51. What is the difference between `==` and `===`?"
    Answer: `==` is a comparison operator that checks for equality of values while performing type coercion if the types differ, whereas `===` checks for strict equality without type conversion.
    Using `===` helps prevent unexpected results caused by type coercion. For example, `5 == '5'` returns `true`, but `5 === '5'` returns `false`.

??? question "52. What is a constructor?"
    Answer: A constructor is a special method used to initialize objects when they are created from a class, typically setting initial values for object properties.
    Constructors help enforce the correct state of an object. For example, in Python, `def __init__(self, value): self.value = value` initializes the object's `value`.

??? question "53. What is the purpose of a destructor?"
    Answer: A destructor is a method that is called when an object is destroyed, allowing for cleanup of resources, such as closing files or freeing memory.
    Destructors help manage resource usage and prevent memory leaks. For example, in C++, `~ClassName()` is a destructor that is invoked when an object of `ClassName` is no longer needed.

??? question "54. What is an interface?"
    Answer: An interface is a contract that defines a set of methods that a class must implement, allowing for a form of multiple inheritance in languages that do not support it directly.
    Interfaces promote a consistent API across different classes. For example, in Java, an interface `Animal` might require implementing methods like `speak()` and `eat()`.

??? question "55. What is polymorphism?"
    Answer: Polymorphism is a programming concept that allows methods to do different things based on the object invoking them, typically achieved through method overriding or interfaces.
    It enables flexibility and code reuse, allowing the same function name to operate on different data types. For example, a function `draw()` can behave differently for `Circle` and `Square` objects.

??? question "56. What is inheritance?"
    Answer: Inheritance is an object-oriented programming principle that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from another class, promoting code reuse.
    The derived class can extend or modify the behavior of the base class. For example, a `Dog` class might inherit from an `Animal` class, gaining its attributes and methods.

??? question "57. What is encapsulation?"
    Answer: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit or class, restricting access to some of the object's components.
    It promotes data hiding and protects the integrity of the data. For example, using private variables in a class to restrict direct access and providing public getter and setter methods.

??? question "58. What is a lambda function?"
    Answer: A lambda function is an anonymous, small function defined with the `lambda` keyword, often used for short, throwaway functions in programming.
    Lambda functions are useful for operations like sorting or filtering. For example, `sorted(list, key=lambda x: x[1])` sorts a list based on the second element of each item.

??? question "59. What is a boolean?"
    Answer: A boolean is a data type that can hold one of two values: `true` or `false`, representing truth values in logical operations.
    Booleans are essential for decision-making and flow control in programs. For example, a condition like `if isActive: performAction()` uses a boolean to determine the flow.

??? question "60. What is type inference?"
    Answer: Type inference is the ability of a programming language to automatically deduce the type of a variable based on its value or context, reducing the need for explicit type declarations.
    This feature enhances code readability and simplicity. For example, in Python, `x = 5` infers `x` as an integer without explicit declaration.

??? question "61. What is a tuple?"
    Answer: A tuple is an immutable collection of ordered elements, allowing for multiple data types to be stored in a single variable.
    Tuples are useful for returning multiple values from a function or grouping related data. For example, `coordinates = (10, 20)` stores an X and Y coordinate.

??? question "62. What is the purpose of a semicolon?"
    Answer: A semicolon is a statement terminator in many programming languages, indicating the end of a statement or command.
    It helps the compiler or interpreter understand where one instruction ends, and another begins. For example, in C or Java, `int a = 5;` uses a semicolon to terminate the statement.

??? question "63. What is a default parameter?"
    Answer: A default parameter is a parameter that has a predefined value if no argument is passed when the function is called.
    Default parameters enhance function flexibility and usability. For example, in Python, `def greet(name="Guest")` allows calling `greet()` without an argument, defaulting to "Guest".

??? question "64. What is a set?"
    Answer: A set is an unordered collection of unique elements, allowing for operations like union, intersection, and difference.
    Sets are useful for eliminating duplicate values and performing mathematical set operations. For example, `unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 3}` results in `unique_numbers` being `{1, 2, 3}`.

??? question "65. What is method overloading?"
    Answer: Method overloading is the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within the same class.
    It allows for different behaviors based on the argument types or numbers. For example, a class may have `add(int a, int b)` and `add(double a, double b)` methods to handle different data types.

??? question "66. What is method overriding?"
    Answer: Method overriding is a feature that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.
    It enables the subclass to define behavior specific to itself while retaining the same method signature. For example, a `Shape` class may have a method `draw()` that is overridden in a `Circle` subclass.

??? question "67. What is a static method?"
    Answer: A static method is a method that belongs to the class rather than any instance of the class and can be called without creating an instance.
    Static methods are useful for utility functions that do not require access to instance variables. For example, `Math.pow(base, exponent)` can be called directly from the class.

??? question "68. What is a recursive function?"
    Answer: A recursive function is a function that calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem, typically breaking it down into smaller subproblems.
    Recursion is often used for tasks like traversing data structures or solving mathematical problems. For example, a function to calculate the factorial of a number can call itself with a decremented value.

??? question "69. What is a syntax tree?"
    Answer: A syntax tree, also known as an abstract syntax tree, is a tree representation of the abstract syntactic structure of source code, illustrating how expressions are parsed.
    Syntax trees are used in compilers and interpreters to understand the structure of code and facilitate code analysis. For example, a syntax tree for an expression like `a + b` shows the `+` operator as the root.

??? question "70. What is a class variable?"
    Answer: A class variable is a variable defined within a class that is shared across all instances of the class, allowing for storage of data that applies to all objects.
    Class variables are useful for properties that should be consistent across all instances. For example, a class representing `Car` may have a class variable `number_of_wheels = 4`.

??? question "71. What is a dynamic type?"
    Answer: A dynamic type refers to a variable whose type is determined at runtime rather than at compile-time, allowing for greater flexibility in programming.
    This feature is common in dynamically typed languages like Python, where you can assign different types to the same variable over time. For example, `x = 10` can later become `x = "Hello"`.

??? question "72. What is a namespace?"
    Answer: A namespace is a container that holds a set of identifiers (names) and ensures that all names are unique within that context, preventing naming conflicts.
    Namespaces help organize code and avoid collisions between variable and function names. For example, in Python, different modules can have functions with the same name without interfering with each other.

??? question "73. What is a switch statement?"
    Answer: A switch statement is a control flow statement that allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values, each with a corresponding block of code.
    It simplifies multi-branch decision-making compared to using multiple `if-else` statements. For example, `switch (day) { case 1: ... }` executes the corresponding block for the matching case.

??? question "74. What is the purpose of the `break` statement?"
    Answer: The `break` statement is used to terminate a loop or switch statement prematurely, transferring control to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.
    It is useful for exiting loops based on a condition, preventing unnecessary iterations. For example, in a `for` loop, `if (x == 10) break;` exits the loop when `x` reaches 10.

??? question "75. What is the difference between a deep copy and a shallow copy?"
    Answer: A shallow copy creates a new object but inserts references into it to the objects found in the original, while a deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all objects found in the original.
    This distinction is important for mutable objects; modifying a shallow copy can affect the original. For example, in Python, `copy.copy()` creates a shallow copy, while `copy.deepcopy()` creates a deep copy.

??? question "76. What is an enumerator?"
    Answer: An enumerator is a special type of class that defines a set of named values, typically used to represent a collection of related constants.
    Enumerators enhance code readability and maintainability. For example, in C#, an `enum Days { Sunday, Monday, Tuesday }` defines a type with specific, meaningful values.

??? question "77. What is a regular expression?"
    Answer: A regular expression is a sequence of characters that form a search pattern, used for string searching, matching, and manipulation.
    Regular expressions are powerful for validating input, parsing text, or performing complex searches. For example, the pattern `\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}` matches a social security number format.

??? question "78. What is a closure?"
    Answer: A closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope, even when the function is executed outside that scope.
    Closures are useful for creating private variables and encapsulating functionality. For example, a function can return another function that accesses its local variables.

??? question "79. What is an abstract class?"
    Answer: An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and typically contains one or more abstract methods that must be implemented by derived classes.
    Abstract classes provide a blueprint for other classes and promote code reusability. For example, an abstract class `Shape` might define an abstract method `area()`, requiring subclasses to implement it.

??? question "80. What is a virtual method?"
    Answer: A virtual method is a method defined in a base class that can be overridden in a derived class, allowing for dynamic dispatch at runtime.
    This feature supports polymorphism and ensures the correct method implementation is called based on the object's runtime type. For example, a base class `Animal` might have a virtual method `sound()` that subclasses override.

??? question "81. What is a callback function?"
    Answer: A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function, allowing the latter to invoke it at a later time, typically after completing a task.
    Callbacks are essential in asynchronous programming for handling operations like events or API calls. For example, in JavaScript, you might pass a function to handle the result of an API call once it completes.

??? question "82. What is a decorator?"
    Answer: A decorator is a special type of function that modifies the behavior of another function or class, often used for enhancing functionality like logging or authentication.
    Decorators allow for cleaner code and separation of concerns. For example, in Python, `@login_required` can be used to restrict access to certain views in a web application.

??? question "83. What is a promise?"
    Answer: A promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation, allowing for easier handling of asynchronous code.
    Promises provide methods like `then()` and `catch()` for chaining actions after the operation completes. For example, `fetch(url).then(response => { /* handle response */ })` uses promises to manage API calls.

??? question "84. What is a generator function?"
    Answer: A generator function is a special type of function that yields a sequence of values using the `yield` keyword, enabling iteration without creating a complete list in memory.
    Generators are memory-efficient for working with large datasets. For example, `def count_up_to(n): for i in range(1, n + 1): yield i` generates numbers on-the-fly.

??? question "85. What is the purpose of the `continue` statement?"
    Answer: The `continue` statement skips the current iteration of a loop and proceeds to the next iteration, allowing for selective execution within the loop.
    It is useful for bypassing certain conditions without breaking the entire loop. For example, `if (x % 2 == 0) continue;` skips even numbers in a loop.

??? question "86. What is a binary tree?"
    Answer: A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left and right child.
    Binary trees are commonly used for organizing data hierarchically, enabling efficient searching and sorting. For example, a binary search tree is used for fast lookups.

??? question "87. What is a linked list?"
    Answer: A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.
    Linked lists allow for efficient insertion and deletion of elements but are less memory efficient compared to arrays. For example, singly linked lists can easily grow in size without reallocating memory.

??? question "88. What is the purpose of the `return` statement?"
    Answer: The `return` statement is used to exit a function and optionally send a value back to the caller, terminating the function's execution.
    It allows functions to produce output based on their input. For example, `def add(a, b): return a + b` returns the sum of `a` and `b` when called.

??? question "89. What is a file descriptor?"
    Answer: A file descriptor is a non-negative integer that uniquely identifies an open file or socket within a process, used by the operating system to manage file I/O.
    File descriptors allow efficient resource management in programming. For example, in Unix-based systems, file descriptors `0`, `1`, and `2` represent standard input, output, and error, respectively.

??? question "90. What is a hash table?"
    Answer: A hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array, mapping keys to values using a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots.
    Hash tables provide average-case constant-time complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions. For example, a hash table can efficiently store and retrieve user data by user ID.

??? question "91. What is the purpose of the `static` keyword?"
    Answer: The `static` keyword is used to define class-level variables and methods that belong to the class itself rather than to any specific instance of the class.
    It allows for shared state and behavior among all instances of a class. For example, a static variable can be used to count the number of instances created from that class.

??? question "92. What is a multithreaded program?"
    Answer: A multithreaded program is one that can execute multiple threads concurrently, allowing for parallel execution and improved application performance.
    This approach is useful for performing background tasks while maintaining responsiveness. For example, a web server can handle multiple requests simultaneously through multithreading.

??? question "93. What is an interface?"
    Answer: An interface is a contract that defines a set of methods that a class must implement, allowing for polymorphism and decoupling of code.
    Interfaces enable different classes to be treated uniformly based on common behaviors. For example, a `Drawable` interface might require methods like `draw()` that any implementing class must define.

??? question "94. What is type inference?"
    Answer: Type inference is the ability of a programming language to automatically deduce the type of an expression at compile-time or runtime, reducing the need for explicit type annotations.
    This feature simplifies code and improves readability. For example, in languages like TypeScript, `let x = 5;` automatically infers that `x` is of type `number`.

??? question "95. What is the difference between `==` and `===` in some programming languages?"
    Answer: The `==` operator checks for value equality with type coercion, while the `===` operator checks for both value and type equality without coercion.
    Using `===` avoids unexpected results caused by type conversion, enhancing code reliability. For example, `5 == '5'` evaluates to `true`, while `5 === '5'` evaluates to `false`.

??? question "96. What is a virtual machine?"
    Answer: A virtual machine is an emulation of a physical computer that executes instructions like a real machine, allowing programs to run in isolated environments.
    Virtual machines enable portability and resource management. For example, Java's Virtual Machine (JVM) allows Java programs to run on any device that has the JVM installed, regardless of the underlying hardware.

??? question "97. What is a data structure?"
    Answer: A data structure is a systematic way of organizing and storing data to enable efficient access and modification, serving as a foundation for algorithm design.
    Different data structures are suited for various tasks; for example, arrays provide fast indexing, while linked lists excel at dynamic memory allocation.

??? question "98. What is the concept of immutability?"
    Answer: Immutability refers to the inability of an object to change its state or value after it has been created, promoting safety in concurrent programming.
    Immutable objects simplify reasoning about code and can lead to fewer bugs. For example, in functional programming, strings are often immutable, preventing accidental modifications.

??? question "99. What is exception handling?"
    Answer: Exception handling is a programming construct that allows developers to manage runtime errors or unusual conditions gracefully, ensuring program stability.
    By using constructs like `try`, `catch`, and `finally`, developers can catch exceptions and perform recovery actions. For example, in Java, `try { /* code */ } catch (Exception e) { /* handle error */ }`.

??? question "100. What is the difference between compiled and interpreted languages?"
    Answer: Compiled languages are translated into machine code before execution, resulting in faster performance, while interpreted languages are executed line-by-line at runtime, often leading to slower performance.
    Compiled languages, like C++, require a compilation step, while interpreted languages, like Python, execute scripts directly. Each approach has its trade-offs in terms of speed, portability, and ease of debugging.

??? question "101. What are primitive data types?"
    Answer: Primitive data types are the basic building blocks of data in a programming language, representing single values without additional methods or properties.
    Common examples include integers, floats, characters, and booleans. They are essential for defining more complex data structures and algorithms.

??? question "102. What is a function?"
    Answer: A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task when called, often taking inputs (parameters) and returning an output (value).
    Functions help in organizing code, promoting reusability, and improving maintainability. For example, a `calculateSum(a, b)` function could return the sum of two numbers.

??? question "103. What is recursion?"
    Answer: Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem, typically breaking it down into smaller subproblems until a base case is reached.
    This approach is useful for tasks like traversing data structures or performing complex calculations, such as calculating factorials or Fibonacci numbers.

??? question "104. What is the purpose of comments in code?"
    Answer: Comments are non-executable lines in the code that provide explanations, annotations, or clarifications to make the code easier to understand for developers.
    They are crucial for documentation and maintenance, helping other developers or the future self understand the logic behind certain decisions. For example, `// This function calculates the area of a circle`.

??? question "105. What is a constructor?"
    Answer: A constructor is a special method in a class that is automatically invoked when an instance of the class is created, allowing for initialization of object attributes.
    Constructors facilitate the setup of object state. For example, a `Circle` class might have a constructor that initializes the radius when a new `Circle` object is created.

??? question "106. What is a framework?"
    Answer: A framework is a pre-built collection of code libraries and tools that provides a foundation for building applications, often following a specific architectural pattern.
    Frameworks streamline development by providing reusable components and enforcing best practices. For example, Django is a web framework for building Python web applications quickly.

??? question "107. What is a library?"
    Answer: A library is a collection of precompiled routines or functions that developers can use to perform common tasks without having to write code from scratch.
    Libraries can save time and effort; for example, the NumPy library in Python provides tools for numerical computations and array manipulations.

??? question "108. What is the significance of `null` or `None`?"
    Answer: `null` (or `None` in some languages) represents the absence of a value or a non-existent reference, indicating that a variable does not point to any object or data.
    This concept is crucial for error handling and flow control, as it helps avoid uninitialized variable errors. For example, checking if a variable is `null` before accessing its properties prevents runtime errors.

??? question "109. What is a variable?"
    Answer: A variable is a named storage location in a program that holds data, allowing for the manipulation and retrieval of that data throughout the program.
    Variables are fundamental for managing state and data flow. For instance, `let count = 10;` defines a variable `count` that stores the integer value `10`.

??? question "110. What is a constant?"
    Answer: A constant is a variable whose value cannot be changed once assigned, promoting immutability and ensuring that critical values remain consistent throughout a program.
    Constants are useful for defining fixed values like mathematical constants. For example, defining `const PI = 3.14;` ensures that the value of `PI` remains unchanged.

??? question "111. What is an array?"
    Answer: An array is a collection of elements of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations, allowing for efficient access and manipulation through indexing.
    Arrays enable easy handling of multiple items, such as a list of student grades. For example, `int grades[] = {90, 85, 78};` initializes an array of integers.

??? question "112. What is a string?"
    Answer: A string is a sequence of characters used to represent text data, often implemented as an array of characters in memory.
    Strings are essential for handling textual information, such as names or descriptions. For example, `let greeting = "Hello, World!";` defines a string variable in many programming languages.

??? question "113. What is a keyword?"
    Answer: A keyword is a reserved word in a programming language that has a predefined meaning and cannot be used as an identifier for variables or functions.
    Keywords define the syntax and structure of the language. For instance, `if`, `else`, and `while` are keywords used for control flow in many programming languages.

??? question "114. What is dynamic typing?"
    Answer: Dynamic typing allows a variable to hold values of different types at different times during execution, providing flexibility but requiring careful error handling.
    This feature can simplify code but may lead to runtime errors if types are not handled properly. For example, in Python, a variable can initially hold an integer and later be reassigned to a string.

??? question "115. What is static typing?"
    Answer: Static typing requires that variable types be defined at compile time, enhancing type safety and enabling early error detection during development.
    This approach can lead to better performance and fewer runtime errors. For example, in Java, a variable must be declared with a type, such as `int count;`, before use.

??? question "116. What is a data type?"
    Answer: A data type is a classification that specifies the type of data a variable can hold, determining the operations that can be performed on it and how it is stored.
    Common data types include integers, floats, characters, and booleans. Understanding data types is essential for effective programming and memory management.

??? question "117. What is operator overloading?"
    Answer: Operator overloading allows developers to define custom behaviors for standard operators (like +, -, *, etc.) for user-defined types, enhancing code readability.
    This feature enables intuitive use of objects. For example, if a `Vector` class supports operator overloading, you could use `v1 + v2` to add two vector instances directly.

??? question "118. What is an object?"
    Answer: An object is an instance of a class that encapsulates data and behavior, representing real-world entities and their characteristics in object-oriented programming.
    Objects provide a way to model complex systems by bundling related data and methods. For example, a `Car` object might contain properties like `color` and `speed` and methods like `accelerate()`.

??? question "119. What is a method?"
    Answer: A method is a function that is associated with an object or class, defining the behaviors that the object can perform.
    Methods allow for encapsulation and modular code. For example, a `Car` class may have methods like `startEngine()` and `stopEngine()` to manage the car's operation.

??? question "120. What is the difference between `public`, `private`, and `protected` access modifiers?"
    Answer: `public` members are accessible from anywhere, `private` members are accessible only within the class, and `protected` members are accessible within the class and its subclasses.
    These modifiers control visibility and encapsulation, promoting data protection. For example, using `private` for sensitive data ensures that it cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.

??? question "121. What is an interface?"
    Answer: An interface is a contract that defines a set of methods and properties that a class must implement without providing any implementation details.
    Interfaces promote a clear separation between the definition of behavior and the implementation, allowing for multiple classes to share the same interface. For example, a `Vehicle` interface might define methods like `start()` and `stop()`.

??? question "122. What is exception handling?"
    Answer: Exception handling is a programming construct that allows developers to manage errors and other exceptional events gracefully without crashing the program.
    It involves using constructs like `try`, `catch`, and `finally` to execute code that may throw exceptions and to define actions to take when exceptions occur. For example, catching an exception when reading a file can prevent the program from terminating unexpectedly.

??? question "123. What is a conditional statement?"
    Answer: A conditional statement is a programming construct that performs different actions based on whether a specified condition is true or false.
    Common conditional statements include `if`, `else if`, and `else`, which control the flow of execution. For instance, an `if` statement can be used to check user input and take action based on its validity.
