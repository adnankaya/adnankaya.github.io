What is the difference between a <code>403 Forbidden</code> and a <code>401 Unauthorized</code> HTTP status code?</summary> <p>Answer: A <code>401 Unauthorized</code> status code indicates that authentication is required, but the user has not provided valid credentials. A <code>403 Forbidden</code> status code means that the user is authenticated but does not have the necessary permissions to access the resource.</p> </details> <details class=question> <summary>83. What is the difference between the <code>POST</code> and <code>PUT</code> methods in HTTP?</summary> <p>Answer: The <code>POST</code> method is used to create a new resource on the server, while the <code>PUT</code> method is used to update an existing resource or create it if it does not exist. <code>POST</code> is generally used when the server decides the URL of the resource, while <code>PUT</code> specifies the URL.</p> </details> <details class=question> <summary>84. What is the purpose of minifying CSS and JavaScript?</summary> <p>Answer: Minifying CSS and JavaScript removes unnecessary characters, such as whitespace and comments, without affecting functionality. This reduces file size, leading to faster load times and improved performance.</p> </details> <details class=question> <summary>85. What is a DNS lookup, and how does it affect web performance?</summary> <p>Answer: A DNS lookup is the process of converting a domain name (like <code>example.com</code>) into an IP address that browsers can use to locate the server. Slow DNS lookups can delay the loading of web pages, affecting performance. Using a CDN or caching DNS queries can help speed this up.</p> </details> <details class=question> <summary>86. What is the difference between the <code>200 OK</code> and <code>201 Created</code> status codes in HTTP?</summary> <p>Answer: A <code>200 OK</code> status code indicates that a request has succeeded, typically used for GET or POST requests. A <code>201 Created</code> status code is used when a new resource has been successfully created on the server, typically in response to a POST request.</p> </details> <details class=question> <summary>87. What is the role of the <code>Accept</code> header in an HTTP request?</summary> <p>Answer: The <code>Accept</code> header in an HTTP request informs the server about the types of content the client can process, such as <code>application/json</code> or <code>text/html</code>. The server uses this information to send back the appropriate content type.</p> </details> <details class=question> <summary>88. What is the <code>Accept-Encoding</code> header, and how does it affect performance?</summary> <p>Answer: The <code>Accept-Encoding</code> header specifies the types of compression the client can handle (e.g., <code>gzip</code>, <code>deflate</code>). By using compression, the server can reduce the size of the data sent to the client, improving performance by decreasing load times and bandwidth usage.</p> </details> <details class=question> <summary>89. What is the purpose of content negotiation in HTTP?</summary> <p>Answer: Content negotiation is the process by which the client and server determine the best format for the response, based on the client's <code>Accept</code> headers and the server's capabilities. It allows the server to deliver the most appropriate content type (e.g., HTML, JSON, XML) for the client's needs.</p> </details> <details class=question> <summary>90. What is a memory leak, and how does it affect web performance?</summary> <p>Answer: A memory leak occurs when a program fails to release memory that is no longer needed, causing it to consume more memory over time. In web development, memory leaks in JavaScript can degrade performance, leading to slower interactions and potentially crashing the browser.</p> </details> <details class=question> <summary>91. What is preloading in web development?</summary> <p>Answer: Preloading is a performance optimization technique that allows developers to instruct the browser to load certain critical resources (like fonts or images) early, before they are requested in the normal rendering flow. It reduces resource loading delays, improving the overall performance of the page.</p> </details> <details class=question> <summary>92. What is an HTTP <code>HEAD</code> request, and when should it be used?</summary> <p>Answer: An HTTP <code>HEAD</code> request retrieves the headers of a resource, without fetching its body. It is used when a client wants to check metadata (e.g., content type, last modified date) without downloading the resource, which can save bandwidth and improve efficiency.</p> </details> <details class=question> <summary>93. What is long polling, and how does it differ from WebSockets?</summary> <p>Answer: Long polling is a technique where the client makes a request to the server, and the server holds the request open until it has new data to send, simulating real-time updates. Unlike WebSockets, which offer full-duplex communication, long polling repeatedly opens and closes HTTP connections.</p> </details> <details class=question> <summary>94. What is the <code>Cache-Control</code> header, and how does it impact performance?</summary> <p>Answer: The <code>Cache-Control</code> header specifies caching policies for HTTP requests and responses, such as how long a resource should be cached by the client or intermediary caches. Effective caching improves performance by reducing server load and decreasing page load times.</p> </details> <details class=question> <summary>95. What is the <code>Last-Modified</code> header in HTTP?</summary> <p>Answer: The <code>Last-Modified</code> header indicates the last time a resource was modified on the server. When used in combination with caching, it allows clients to make conditional requests (e.g., <code>If-Modified-Since</code>) to check whether the resource has changed and avoid downloading it unnecessarily.</p> </details> <details class=question> <summary>96. What is a 503 Service Unavailable error?</summary> <p>Answer: A <code>503 Service Unavailable</code> error occurs when the server is temporarily unable to handle the request, often due to being overloaded or undergoing maintenance. It indicates that the server should be available again after some time.</p> </details> <details class=question> <summary>97. What is the difference between a <code>GET</code> request and a <code>DELETE</code> request in HTTP?</summary> <p>Answer: A <code>GET</code> request retrieves data from the server, while a <code>DELETE</code> request is used to remove a resource from the server. <code>GET</code> is used for safe operations (no state changes), while <code>DELETE</code> modifies the server's state by removing resources.</p> </details> <details class=question> <summary>98. What is DNS prefetching, and how does it improve performance?</summary> <p>Answer: DNS prefetching is a browser feature that pre-resolves domain names before the user navigates to them, reducing the time spent on DNS lookups. By resolving these names early, the browser can load resources faster, improving page load performance.</p> </details> <details class=question> <summary>99. What is the difference between <code>300 Multiple Choices</code> and <code>301 Moved Permanently</code> in HTTP?</summary> <p>Answer: A <code>300 Multiple Choices</code> status code indicates that multiple possible responses are available, and the client can choose one. A <code>301 Moved Permanently</code> status code tells the client that the requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL, and all future requests should be directed there.</p> </details> <details class=question> <summary>100. What is the difference between a resource being cached by a browser and a resource being cached by a CDN?</summary> <p>Answer: When a browser caches a resource, it stores it locally on the user's device, so it can be quickly accessed without re-downloading it on subsequent visits. When a CDN caches a resource, it is stored on a distributed network of servers closer to the user, reducing latency and improving performance for all visitors to the site."</p> </details> </article> </div> <script>var target=document.getElementById(location.hash.slice(1));target&&target.name&&(target.checked=target.name.startsWith("__tabbed_"))</script> </div> <button type=button class="md-top md-icon" data-md-component=top hidden> <svg xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg viewbox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M13 20h-2V8l-5.5 5.5-1.42-1.42L12 4.16l7.92 7.92-1.42 1.42L13 8z"/></svg> Back to top </button> </main> <footer class=md-footer> <div class="md-footer-meta md-typeset"> <div class="md-footer-meta__inner md-grid"> <div class=md-copyright> <div class=md-copyright__highlight> Copyright &copy; 2023 -
